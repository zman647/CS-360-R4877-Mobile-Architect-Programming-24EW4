Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  The app was created to fulfill user needs of data management, permissions handling, and notifications management.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  The necessities for screens were a data display screen, a login screen, and permissions screen. The UI kept users in mind by trying to be clear and concise. It was simple and not overcomplicated.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  I used modular code and made a lot of reusable components. this allowed the code to be simple, and less overall pieces that still achieved the same end goal. This is efficient and makes a coders life and his future time much better.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I did mostly UI testing. I wanted to make sure that everything worked as intended, seamlessly, and without errors.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had to innovate within the permissions function to get it to function correctly. I also had to make sure that the real time data inputs were capable of being deleted and changed.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe the best job I did was making efficient well organized code. I am sure it is not perfect, but that is the one strong point that I believe I had.
